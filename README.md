# 🎬 AE Expression Library (Beginner Friendly)

This is a personal tool I built using Python and Tkinter — with zero prior coding experience and a LOT of help from ChatGPT. It started as a way to organize my own expressions in After Effects, and now I’m sharing it to help other editors too.

### 💡 What It Does:
- Save, edit, and organize custom AE expressions
- Add explanations and usage tips
- Mark favorites and filter expressions
- Search instantly by name or tag
- Supports animated GIF previews (if you want to upload your own)

### 📁 Comes With:
- ✅ 100 commonly used After Effects expressions
- ✅ AE term definitions with syntax and real usage examples

### 🧠 Why Use It?
If you're a beginner, you know the struggle:  
Scrolling through old files, hunting down expressions, and wasting time switching between docs.  
This tool keeps everything in one place — searchable, visual, and easy to use.

### 🖼️ Expression Previews (Optional)
If you want to upload your own visual previews, you can!  
The preferred size for GIFs is: **420x580 px**  
Just place them in the appropriate preview folder (see code comments for more info).
